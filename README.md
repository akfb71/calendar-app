This is a simple single page web application that displays a calendar. The calender does the following : 
*  On page load, the calendar displays the current month in a normal calendar format, with an abbreviated name and year in the header.
*  The current day of the month are highlighted in gray.
*  Past days are grayed-out.
*  Days that do not belong to the currently displayed month should not appear.
*  There are arrows in the calendar header that allow you to cycle to the previous and following months, respectively.
* You can click on today’s date or any future date in the month, and that selected date will be highlighted in green. You will not be able to select a past date.
