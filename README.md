# calendarApp

This is a simple single page web application that displays a calendar. The calender does the following : 
1. On page load, the calendar displays the current month in a normal calendar format, with an abbreviated name and year in the header.
2. The current day of the month are highlighted in gray.
3. Past days are grayed-out.
4. Days that do not belong to the currently displayed month should not appear.
5. There are arrows in the calendar header that allow you to cycle to the previous and following months, respectively.
6. You can click on todayâ€™s date or any future date in the month, and that selected date will be highlighted in green. You will not be able to select a past date.
